== SMTP Error Messages ==

= Communication Error [334] make sure the Envelope From Email is the same account used to create the Client ID. =

* This is almost always caused by being logged in to Google/Microsoft/Yahoo with a different user than the one Post is configured to send mail with. Logout and try again with the correct user
* Login to [Webmail](http://www.gmail.com) and see if there is an "Unusual Activity" warning waiting for your attention

= Could not open socket =

* Your host may have installed a firewall between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use SSL over port 587. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Operation Timed out =

* Your host may have poor connectivity to the mail server. Try doubling the Read Timeout.
* Your host may have installed a firewall (DROP packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use TLS over port 465. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Connection refused =

Your host has likely installed a firewall (REJECT packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.

= 503 Bad sequence of commands =

You configured TLS security when you should have selected no security.

= XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism not supported =

You may be on a Virtual Private Server that is [playing havoc with your communications](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-xoauth2-authentication-mechanism-not-supported?replies=9). Jump ship.

== Mail ends up in the Spam folder ==

To avoid being flagged as spam, you need to prove your email isn't forged. On a custom domain, its up to YOU to set that up:

* Ensure you are using the correct SMTP server with authentication - the correct SMTP server is the one defined by your email service's SPF record
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add an [SPF record](http://www.openspf.org/Introduction) to your DNS zone file. The SPF is specific to your email provider, for example [Google](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786)
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add a DKIM record to your DNS zone file and upload your Domain Key (a digital signature) to, for example [Google]((https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en))
